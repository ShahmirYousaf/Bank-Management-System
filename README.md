# Complaint Management System

Welcome to the Complaint Management System project! This project is developed using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, with a focus on software design principles to ensure a robust and efficient system for managing complaints.

## Overview

The Complaint Management System is designed to streamline the process of handling complaints within an organization or institution. It provides a structured approach to receiving, tracking, and resolving complaints, thereby improving customer satisfaction and organizational efficiency.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: The system offers an intuitive interface for users to submit and track their complaints.
  
- **Complaint Submission**: Users can easily submit their complaints through the system, providing details such as complaint type, description, and priority.

- **Complaint Tracking**: The system allows users and administrators to track the status of complaints, including their current status and any actions taken.

- **Complaint Resolution**: Administrators can assign complaints to appropriate personnel for resolution and monitor the progress until the complaint is resolved.

- **Reporting**: The system generates reports and statistics on complaint trends, resolution times, and other relevant metrics to facilitate analysis and decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core programming language used for implementing the system logic.
  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: OOP principles are employed to organize the codebase into classes and objects, enhancing modularity and reusability.

- **Software Design Principles**: Design principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism are applied to ensure a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

## Getting Started

To run the Complaint Management System project, simply compile the source code files using a C++ compiler and execute the resulting executable file. Follow the prompts to navigate through the system and utilize its features.
